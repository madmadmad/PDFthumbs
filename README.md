# PDFthumbs
A few simple routines for rendering a PDF to a PNG thumbnail. Uses Mozilla's pdf.js library.

Renders a PNG client-side and makes an AJAX call on the server to save it to disk.

You'll find server-side solutions which require ImageMagick and Ghost installed on said server.
This requires nothing but what is here.
